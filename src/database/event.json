    "description": "Falguni Pathak, known as the “Queen of Dandiya,” will headline Dandiya Dhoom 2025 in Jackson, New Jersey, on September 13. A beloved figure in Gujarati music and pop culture, Pathak is famous for blending traditional Navratri folk tunes with contemporary beats, creating performances that are both devotional and electric. Her shows feature several crowd favorites alongside high-energy Garba and dandiya numbers that invite audience participation. Navratri, a nine-night Hindu festival honoring Goddess Durga, is celebrated with dance and music across India and the diaspora. In the US, Garba nights have become some of the largest gatherings for Gujarati communities, serving as both cultural expression and community-building events. This concert offers an opportunity for audiences of all backgrounds to experience the vibrancy of South Asian traditions through music, dance, and ritual. For New Jersey, home to one of the largest Gujarati populations outside India, the event is more than entertainment: it is a cultural bridge, reinforcing diaspora ties while showcasing diversity within the broader American landscape.",
