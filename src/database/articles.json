    "context": "In response to mounting legal and political pressure, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced that it would begin reinstating SEVIS records for international students who were not at fault, reversing a controversial policy that had abruptly stripped thousands of students of their F‑1 visa status. Earlier, ICE and the State Department had deactivated SEVIS records for at least 4,700 students, many of them Indian, citing past visa denials, minor infractions, or flawed data from law enforcement databases. The terminations led to an immediate loss of legal status, cutting off access to employment, housing, and university enrollment. The visa cancellations triggered over 70 lawsuits and more than 40 temporary injunctions across 21 states, which forced ICE to reverse course. However, many students remain in legal limbo, particularly those whose F‑1 visas were formally revoked by the State Department and who are still barred from reentering the United States. Indian-American lawmakers, legal groups, and diaspora advocates played a central role in pushing back against this overreach. India has overtaken China as the top sender of international students to the United States, with 331,602 Indians enrolled in US institutions in 2023-24, contributing an estimated $11.8 billion.",
    "exalt_take": "The reinstatement of SEVIS records is a welcome correction and a relief for thousands of immigrants, a majority of whom are Indian-origin. While ICE’s reversal came after legal pressure and public outrage, it’s unclear how many of the 4,700 plus affected students will fully recover their legal footing, especially those still stranded abroad due to visa revocations. With Indian students now representing nearly a third of all international students in the US and contributing over $11 billion to the education economy, abrupt enforcement actions like this one risk long-term damage to US higher education, labor markets, and global credibility. They also risk alienating Indian Americans for who view such instances as not just policy decisions but scathing attacks on legitimate pathways to immigration, the very channels they utilized to realize their American dream. This also explains why Indian-American lawmakers, legal groups, and diaspora advocates played a central role in pushing back against this overreach. It is important for public office holders to recognize the fears, anxiety, and chaos running through the community and support them accordingly. For Democrats, express solidarity with Indian-origin and other international students and push for legislative guardrails that prevent mass SEVIS terminations without individual review or notice. Champion accountability and oversight of immigration data-sharing between law enforcement and ICE. For Republicans, acknowledge the concerns of the community and reinforce America’s leadership in STEM education and innovation by protecting legal student pathways like F‑1 and OPT. Support targeted reforms to SEVIS and NCIC data systems to prevent wrongful enforcement without weakening border control. Frame student stability as an economic and diplomatic imperative, particularly with key partners like India.",

The San Francisco Bay Area office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-SFBA) welcomed the hate crime charges, and Alameda County District Attorney Pamela Price condemned the act. Indian Americans number over 5.2 million in the US, with California hosting the largest population. Hate crimes against 'other ethnicity/national origin' incidents, which often target South Asians, saw a significant rise in California in 2024.",
    "exalt_take": "The assault incident in a city with one of the largest Indian-origin populations like Fremont is an alarming incident. What adds to the gravity is that it is not an isolated incident but a part of a growing pattern of racially motivated attacks that increasingly target South Asian communities, even in diverse, immigrant-rich regions like the Bay Area. That it occurred in broad daylight at a family restaurant underscores the urgency of improving local law enforcement responsiveness. With California housing nearly a million Indian Americans and Fremont being a central hub, this incident resonates far beyond one city, highlighting the insecurity felt by a community that is among the most visible and economically successful immigrant groups in the country. Public officeholders must issue a statement recognizing the incident as a hate crime, express solidarity with the victims and reassure Indian and other immigrant groups in the US of their safety by calling for prosecution to the fullest extent. For Democrats, bolster local and federal funding for hate crime tracking, disaggregated data collection (including by national origin), and support services for immigrant victims of violence. Push for passage of legislation to improve local hate crime reporting and victim support, especially for South Asian, Muslim, Sikh, and Hindu Americans who remain underrepresented in federal hate crime data. Encourage community-based interventions, including school-level anti-bias programming and cultural sensitivity training for law enforcement officers in high-diversity districts. For Republicans, acknowledge the attack as an assault on American values of safety, decency, and individual freedom regardless of background, and support stronger enforcement of existing hate crime laws. Promote bipartisan backing for resources that protect all residents including immigrant families from targeted violence, ensuring swift prosecutions and fair trials for such offenses. Reinforce the need for community safety partnerships that involve faith leaders, cultural associations, and local businesses in hate crime prevention efforts.

    "context": "On April 22, 2025, Islamist militants killed at least 26 Hindu tourists in the Baisaran valley of Pahalgam in Indian Kashmir, the deadliest terror attack in the region since 2019. The attack coincided with US Vice President JD Vance’s visit to India. New Delhi announced diplomatic measures against Pakistan, accusing them of involvement and putting the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance. Indian-American communities across the US organized vigils and protests, condemning the attack. The Indian-American diaspora numbers over 5.2 million, and Hindus comprise about 0.9% of US adults.",
    "exalt_take": "The Pahalgam killings mark one of the deadliest attacks in Indian-administered Kashmir in over half a decade, highlighting the region’s volatility despite recent tourism rebound. The Indian government’s swift retaliation, including suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, signals a hardened diplomatic stance toward Pakistan. Indian-American communities across the US mobilized rapidly in response. Vigils and memorials from New Jersey to Houston saw diaspora leaders, local officials, and even US lawmakers speak out. While many Hindu Americans, a group that makes up nearly 1% of US adults, condemned the killings and rallied for justice, others worry about escalation, polarization, and the weaponization of diaspora grief for partisan gain. Both parties face a balancing act between addressing the concerns of the Indian diaspora and assuring Pakistani Americans, who are also a sizable diaspora group, of their safety. It is also important to bear in mind that both Pakistan and India remain allies of the US and public officeholders cannot risk alienating either. Attacks like Pahalgam resonate deeply, especially among Kashmiri Pandits and first-generation Hindus whose political engagement is rising in states like Texas, Georgia, and New Jersey. Recognizing their trauma, without flattening complex regional dynamics, will be key. For Democrats, acknowledge the targeted killing of Hindu pilgrims while reiterating the need for safeguarding all civilian populations in South Asia, including Kashmiri Muslims. Use the attack as a moment to spotlight Pakistan’s history of harboring extremist groups and pressure the Trump administration to reconsider bilateral aid and strategic designations. Recognize diaspora trauma while resisting sweeping generalizations that conflate advocacy for victims with extremism. For Republicans, advocate for counter-terror intelligence sharing, drone surveillance cooperation, and greater Indo-Pacific security coordination. Echo calls for justice from Indian American groups, particularly in battleground states with growing Hindu American influence (e.g., Georgia, Texas, Michigan).

The brutal Pahalgam terrorist attack occurred during his visit, which Vance swiftly condemned. The visit highlighted deepening India-US ties, with bilateral trade hitting $118 billion in 2023-24. Usha Vance’s Indian identity and Hindu faith were a focal point, underscoring the growing political clout of Indian Americans and serving as a unique bridge between the GOP and the Indian diaspora.",
    "exalt_take": "Vice President JD Vance’s India visit served as both a diplomatic signal and a soft power showcase. His family’s presence, especially highlighted by that of Usha Vance, amplified the emotional and cultural stakes of the trip, resonating with Indian audiences abroad and at home. What made the visit especially resonant was the presence of Usha Vance, a practicing Hindu and Indian-origin Second Lady, whose ancestral roots and cultural fluency struck a chord with audiences in both countries. Prayer ceremonies in her home village ahead of the 2024 election and her high favorability among Indian Americans reflect the emotional power of diasporic connections in modern diplomacy. The GOP’s increasing visibility among Indian-American voters, though still trailing Democrats, is no accident. Figures like Usha Vance are reshaping political appeal within this influential, fast-growing bloc. For both parties, the message is clear - cultural credibility and meaningful outreach are becoming as important as policy alignment. For Republicans, elevate culturally resonant figures. Usha Vance’s visibility, grounded in her Hindu faith, Indian heritage, and personal authenticity, helped humanize the administration’s foreign policy and connected with diaspora voters. Continue investing in public diplomacy that highlights such relatable leadership. Follow symbolism with substance. Moves like temple visits and family tours signal goodwill, but must be paired with deliverables on immigration policy, skilled worker visas, or India-focused trade to maintain credibility with Indian-American voters. For Democrats, don’t assume diaspora loyalty. While Indian Americans still lean heavily Democratic, GOP figures like Usha Vance are closing the gap, especially among younger, religiously observant, or socially conservative voters. Ensure India-U.S. ties remain a campaign talking point, not an afterthought.",

India's energy demand is projected to rise, and it imports over 85 percent of its crude oil. This comes amid geopolitical shifts, where Russia became India's primary crude oil supplier after Western sanctions in 2022. The increase in US crude exports to India helps fill a gap as India's imports of Russian crude saw a slight decrease.",
    "exalt_take": "India's pivot towards US crude and LNG is part of a broader strategy to enhance its energy security by reducing its historical dependence on a volatile Middle East and, more recently, a single dominant supplier in Russia.

The growing energy partnership is a tangible sign of the deepening strategic alignment between the two countries, even as they navigate complex issues like Russia and trade imbalances. For Democrats, support expansion of energy ties beyond crude oil to include LNG infrastructure, green hydrogen pilots, and carbon capture partnerships with Indian public-sector oil companies. For Republicans, champion the India oil trade as a counter to China-Russia energy blocs, leverage growing exports to India to position the US as the democratic world’s energy anchor.

Edlow argued that such authorizations overstep regulatory authority, contrasting Trump’s previous stance on green cards for international graduates.

    "exalt_take": "The Trump administration’s revived push to end Optional Practical Training (OPT) and STEM OPT is a scathing attack on the limited legitimate pathways to employment for international students, especially from India. Indians represent the largest cohort using OPT and face uncertainty about their futures, even as they invest heavily in US education. The programs in question are not loopholes; they are structured, regulated bridges between higher education and the workforce, central to the US appeal for top global talent. Ending them would not only sever these bridges but also damage US universities, tech industries, and the broader economy, all of which benefit from the skills and spending of foreign graduates. This move risks accelerating the global talent shift away from the US toward countries with more stable post-study work opportunities. For Democrats, lean into your longstanding support for international education and skilled immigration. Reintroduce or strengthen legislative protections for OPT and STEM OPT, and hold the line against executive overreach.

Explicitly call out Edlow’s OPT stance and express solidarity with international students and Indians who pursue the American dream. For Republicans, exercise restraint in politicizing academic-to-employment pipelines. While border security and immigration enforcement remain core to your platform, aggressive targeting of international student work programs may undercut US economic and technological leadership and also alienate a key voting bloc, that is, Indian Americans.

    "context": "India launched Operation Sindoor, a series of military strikes on terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), on May 7th, following the Pahalgam militant attack. India described the operation as 'focused, measured, and non-escalatory.' Pakistan criticized the strikes as a 'blatant act of war,' retaliating with drone attacks and cross-border shelling. A fragile ceasefire was reached around May 10th after intensive diplomatic contacts, with the US, through Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, actively intervening to prevent nuclear escalation. Indian-American organizations and lawmakers quickly mobilized, supporting India’s right to defend itself while urging de-escalation. The altered patterns in arms flow show India shifting from Russian arms towards Western allies, while Pakistan's arsenal is largely Chinese, highlighting new alignments in the Indo-Pacific. Both India and Pakistan are strategic partners for the US, making Washington’s role as a diplomatic bridge indispensable to avoid destabilization.",
    "exalt_take": "Both India and Pakistan remain key strategic partners for the United States, with strong political, economic, and security ties. Indian Americans, the largest Asian-origin group in the US, and Pakistani Americans, also a sizable, influential community, expect US public officials to avoid alienating either side. Messaging around India’s military operations and any Pakistani response should focus on a united global front against terrorism while urging immediate de-escalation to prevent further civilian casualties. The nuclear dimension of the conflict remains a pressing concern, making Washington’s role as a diplomatic bridge indispensable. US leaders should reaffirm that America will continue to work closely with both governments, monitor the situation closely, and extend necessary support to its allies in ways that uphold regional stability and international law. This is a complex balancing act that must be executed right to ensure there is no mistrust between the diaspora communities in the US, but saying nothing would also alienate Indian Americans on grounds of inaction. For Democrats, while the basic messaging remains the same for both parties, lay emphasis on human rights, civilian protection, and conflict de-escalation. Reference international law and multilateral diplomacy (UN engagement, regional peace frameworks). Connect to South Asian diaspora community safety in the US, especially in times of heightened tensions abroad. For Republicans, lay emphasis on counterterrorism and defense cooperation. Highlight India as a strategic partner against China in the Indo-Pacific, while acknowledging Pakistan’s role in counterterrorism. Stress America’s credibility as a security partner that supports allies’ rights to defend themselves against terrorism.",

    "context": "India proposed counter-duties on US goods, up to $7.6 billion, in response to the US tariffs on aluminium and steel, which were first introduced by the Trump administration in 2018 and reiterated in 2025. This move comes amid ongoing trade negotiations for a long-term deal. India, previously referred to as a “tariff king” by Trump, seeks to reduce its trade deficit. Bilateral trade reached $129 billion in 2024, with a $46 billion surplus favoring India. A timeline of events includes 'Mission 500' to double trade by 2030, Indian concessions, and a 90-day pause on tariffs by Trump, leading to a 'roadmap' for a US-India Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA). India's WTO notice formalizes its retaliation amidst efforts to finalize a mini trade deal.",
    "exalt_take": "India’s WTO notice proposing counter-tariffs on up to $7.6 billion in US goods is a sign of escalating trade skirmish between India and the US, one which has been met with fraught anxiety. With bilateral trade at $129 billion in 2024 and a $46 billion surplus in India’s favor, this is a dispute embedded in a broader contest over structural trade imbalances and tariff philosophies. Alienating New Delhi on economic terms risks ripple effects in diaspora engagement, especially in swing states where Indian-American turnout has been decisive. Overall, keep trade disagreements compartmentalized so they don’t bleed into security and immigration channels. A US-India tariff escalation could sour ongoing talks on skilled worker visas and STEM talent flows, issues where diaspora lobbying is strongest. Given that steel and aluminium comprise only 5.2% of India’s US-bound exports, this fight is more about political signaling than industrial survival. Calibrated, face-saving compromises can protect both economies and the bilateral trust needed to hit “Mission 500” trade goals. For Democrats, this is an opportunity to call for restraint and push for a mutually beneficial trade agreement. Recognize the importance of trade relations with India while also highlighting that trade is only a part of the equation- reaffirm the Indo-Pacific as a cornerstone of US foreign policy, and India, a vital ally. Linking metals tariff reform to broader cooperation in clean energy, semiconductors, and a digital economy, could resonate with diaspora voters who value economic modernization and US-India alignment. For Republicans, it would be prudent to frame negotiations as securing fair reciprocity without slipping into full-blown trade war territory. That means even while using the metals dispute as a bargaining chip for market openings in US farm goods, defense contracts, and whiskey, publicly recognizing India’s strategic role against China and an overall democratic partner in the Indo-Pacific, a point that resonates strongly in diaspora policy circles.",
